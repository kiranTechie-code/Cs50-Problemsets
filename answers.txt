sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?:

In Bubble Sort, the best-case time is significantly less than the worst-case time. For instance:

Worst case (Reversed5000.txt): 0.076 seconds
Best case (Sorted5000.txt): 0.027 seconds

Here, the worst-case time is approximately twice the best-case time.


sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?:

reversed50000.txt -> 0.807s
Comparing to other sorting Techniques this was considered as fastest for the huge number, so this uses merge sort

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?:

reversed5000.txt -> 0.051s
sorted5000.txt -> 0.053s

For reversed5000.txt, the time taken was 0.051 seconds, and for Sorted5000.txt, it was 0.053 seconds.

This behavior aligns with Selection Sort, as both the worst-case and best-case times are expected to be equal or nearly equal in this sorting technique.
